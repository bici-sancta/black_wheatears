Black Wheatears - basic regression analysis

Black Wheatears, are small birds of Spain and Morocco.  Males of the species demonstrate an exaggerated sexual display by carrying many heavy stones to nesting cavities.  This 35-gram bird transports, on average, 3.1 kg of stones per nesting season!  Different males carry somewhat different sized stones, prompting a study of whether larger stones may be a signal of higher health status.   M. Soler et al. calculated the average stone mass (g) carried by each of 21 male black wheaters, along with T-cell response measurements reflecting their immune systemâ€™ strengths.  

Analyze the data and write a statistical report (by answering the questions below); treat the T-cell as the response and the stone mass as the explanatory variable.
